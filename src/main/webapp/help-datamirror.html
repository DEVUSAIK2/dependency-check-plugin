    Specifies the optional data mirroring scheme. By default, Dependency-Check will utilize NIST CPE/CVE data directly
    from the Internet. Dependency-Check may optionally be configured to obtain this data by two alternate methods:
    <ul>
        <li>Data archive: This method requires a ZIP of a pre-processed Dependency-Check data directory. This option
        can greatly reduce the time spent processing NIST updates but requires the data archive to be processed by
        the same version (or compatible version) of Dependency-Check.
        <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Track_Project">OWASP Dependency-Track</a> has this
        capability built-in. Data archives may be accessed from http://hostname/dtrack/dcdata</li>

        <li>NIST CPE/CVE: This method requires a mirror of NIST server data by creating copies of NIST XML data,
        potentially modifying their contents and serving them via a URL</li>
    </ul>
