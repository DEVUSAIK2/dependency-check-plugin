    The entire path and fileName to the DependencyCheck jar file.
    <p>
        The development filenames are not currently consistent and binaries are not yet available. Therefore it is
        necessary to specify the absolute path and fileName to the DependencyCheck jar file, not included. The jar
        will be located in the 'target' directory created from the 'package' target when building DependencyCheck.
