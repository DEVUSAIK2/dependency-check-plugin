    This setting specifies a URL where a pre-processed data directory resides containing CPE/CVE indices and database.
    This is a global setting that, if specified, will allow all jobs using the Builder step to use locally stored
    copy of the data directory from a remote server. By using batch update, large Jenkins deployments behind a firewall
    may be managed easier and the time to execute each job is reduced since the data directory is already pre-processed
    and up-to-date.
