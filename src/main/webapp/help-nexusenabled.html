    If enabled, the Nexus analyzer will run as part of a Dependency-Check scan.
    The Nexus analyzer will search Maven Central for the SHA-1 of the dependency.
    If found, the groupId, artifactId, and version are added as Vendor, Product,
    and Version evidence, respectively. Furthermore, it adds a new Identifier with
    the Maven coordinates for the jar identified.
    </p><p>
    When used with internal Nexus repositories, non-Maven jars (such as vendor-provided libraries, etc.)
    can be identified with greater accuracy.
