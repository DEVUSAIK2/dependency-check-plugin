    <strong>DEPRECATED:</strong>
    <br>
    Jenkins global web proxy settings are used by Dependency-Check, and requests to online ressources (like
    the NVD data feeds, Retire.js, NPM Audit, etc.) are, by default, made via this web proxy (if there is
    one configured).
    <br>
    The "bypass proxy" option allows completely ignoring the Jenkins proxy configuration for Dependency-Check.
    It used to be an appropriate setting in environements where, for instance, a local NVD mirror was available.
    <br>
    Dependency-check now also takes into account the exceptions list from Jenkins global proxy configuration
    (the "no proxy hosts" list).  The best way to bypass the web proxy for a specific target host is thus to
    add it to the exceptions list.  This allows fine-grained, per-target-host, configuration, which supersedes
    the "bypass proxy" option.
