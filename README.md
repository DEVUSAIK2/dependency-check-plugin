Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin
==============================

Dependency-Check is a utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly 
disclosed, vulnerabilities. This tool can be part of the solution to the OWASP Top 10 2017: A9 - Using 
Components with Known Vulnerabilities. This plug-in can independently execute a Dependency-Check analysis and 
visualize results.

More information can be found on the [wiki].
