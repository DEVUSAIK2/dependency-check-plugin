DependencyCheck Jenkins Plugin
==============================

DependencyCheck is a utility that attempts to detect publically disclosed vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

The DependencyCheck Jenkins Plugin features the ability to perfom a dependency analsysis build and later view results post build.

More information can be found on the [wiki].
